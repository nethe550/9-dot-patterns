# 9-Dot Patterns
A project experimenting with the Android-style 9 dot pattern lock.
This is currently just a test for rendering a variable amount of dots to a grid on an HTML canvas.

Adjustable controls are grid size, colorized, and generation of random patterns.

Note: These patterns are not valid Android-style 9 dot patterns (yet).

## How to use:
Run these commands to clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/nethe550/9-dot-patterns.git

cd ./9-dot-patterns/
```

Once you are in the cloned repo, just open `index.html` in your preferred web browser (Tested in Firefox).

## Generating JSDoc:
(Windows) - To generate the JSDoc, run the `./helpers/generateDocs.bat` script.

(Linux) - If you are on linux, I'm sure you can figure out how to install and use jsdoc.
